Object Detection with Google Tensorflow Object Detection API and Annotation

1. Follow the installation process on https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md
   until Protobuf Compilation(included).

2. Check where the tensorflow packages are used and adapt the paths in "ObjectDetection.py" file to your tensorflow directory.

3. Again adapting the path to your tensorflow directory, run "export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/tensorflow/models/" on terminal,
   in the directory where you will run the object detector.

4. Run objectDetection.py.

The annotations of each video will be in "annotations" folder separated video by video.
